	This package implements three types of Normalization in the domain of mass spectrometry data as a KNIME node.

	<p>
		The <code>NormalizationModel</code> contains the KNIME implementation of the Normalization logic.
		This class is dependent on <code>msk.util.preprocess.Normalizer</code> which stores all logic.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <code>NormalizationDialog</code> is a basic GUI which allows the user to choose
		what method of normalization they are going to use. It extends <code>DefaultNodeSettingsPane</code> 
		as it is easy to use and quick to code.
	</p>
