    <shortDescription>
        We use this node to Normalize rows of data in several different ways specified by the user.
        This node is targeted towards the processing of mass spectrometry data.

        <intro>
       		This node is useful for normalizing mass spectrometry intensities. It supports 3 methods of normalization.
        </intro>
        
        <option name="TIC">
       		This is the industry standard in normalization of MSI data, specifically, it calculates the Total Ion Count, ie the sum of the intensities. 
       		Then we divide each intensity in that spectrum by its TIC.
        </option>
        <option name="Median">
        	This method of normalization is simple and is gaining popularity in MSI. We simply calculate the median intensity for a spectrum.
        	Then we divide each intensity value by this.
        </option>
		<option name="Euclidean Norm">
			This method of Normalization involves calculating the Euclidean Norm of the intensities of our Mass spectrometry data.
			Then we divide each intensity value by this.
		</option>

       		The incoming data should contain rows of data that are to be independently normalized.

        	The outgoing data consists of the normalized incoming data.
