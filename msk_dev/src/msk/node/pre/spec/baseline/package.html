<body>

	This package implements a node for baseline removal, specifically catered to the 
	use of mass spectrometry datasets, but can be used for other data, it specifically
	removes the baseline from each row in the incoming data.

	<p>
		The <code>BaselineModel</code> is dependent on <code>msk.util.preprocess.Baseline</code> 
		which stores all the logic for 4 methods of baseline removal.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <code>BaselineDialog</code> provides a very basic GUI for the user to select only 
		the method of baseline removal, and to choose the size of the window in which we calculate the baseline.
		The class extends <code>DefaultNodeSettingsPane</code> which makes this easy and quick to code.
	</p>
