    <name>Baseline Subtraction</name>   
   
    <shortDescription>
   		Use this node to perform baseline subtraction to remove baseline noise from the spectra.

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
        	This node is useful to subtract baseline noise from mass spectra, supports multiple types of baseline subtraction.
        	For each row in the input data, we calculate the baseline for windows across the whole spectra, then remove the baseline value from all values in that given window.
        	Once this is done, we remove all negative values and set them equal to zero.
        </intro>      
            
        <tab name="Baseline Type">
            <option name="Minimum">
            	If chosen, the baseline is calculated as the minimum of the values in each window.
            </option>
           	<option name="Median">
           		If chosen, the baseline is calculated as the median in each window.
           	</option>
           	<option name="Tophat">    
           		If chosen, the baseline is calculated as the morphological operator tophat of the values in the window. 
           		This means the opening, which refers to the dilation of the erosion.
           	</option>
           	<option name="Optimal Tophat">    
           		If chosen, the baseline is calculated using morphological operators. Specifically, 
           		it is the minimum of the opening, and the average between the dilation of the opening, and the erosion of the opening.
           		As explained by Roasanna Perez-Pueyo, Maria Jose Soneira and Sergio Ruiz-Moreno in Morphology-Based Automated Baseline Removal for Raman Spectra of Artistic Pigments.

        </tab>
        
       	<option name="Window Size/Structuring Element">
       		This refers to the size of the window that we use when calculating the baseline at a specific point. 
       		This could have several different effects on the resulting baseline, depending on the baseline removal method that is chose.
