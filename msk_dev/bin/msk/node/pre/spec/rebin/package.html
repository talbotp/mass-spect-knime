	This package implements a KNIME node for Rebinning Mass spectrometry datasets.

	<p>
		The <code>RebinnerModel</code> stores all KNIME logic, and an interface between the logic and KNIME.
		It is dependent on <code>msk.util.preprocess.Rebinner</code> which stores the logic. The logic is based off of Algorithm 2 in Alan Races Spectral Analysis paper.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <code>RebinnerDialog</code> is a simple GUI allowing the user to specify the minimum and maximum m/z values, and the size of the bins to be used.
		The class extends <code>DefaultNodeSettingsPane</code> for ease and speed of coding.
