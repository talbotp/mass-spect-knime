    <shortDescription>
        We use this node to rebin the data, this should be one of the first steps in preprocessing the mass spectrometry data.
       	This is aimed to convert processed imzML data so that it can be compared to continuous imzML data.

        <intro>
        	This node takes three pieces of information from the user, specifically the minimum m/z value, the maximum m/z value. and the bin width.
       		This information is then used to fit the incoming data into these bins of the specified width, such that the incoming data is between the minimum and maximum inclusively. 
       		Specifically, all m/z outside of the specified range are essentially 'chopped off' of the dataset.
        </intro>
        
        <option name="Minimum m/z">
       		This is the minimum m/z that we bin from, all data less than this is 'chopped off' and thus is no longer considered.
        </option>
        <option name="Maximum m/z">
        	This is the minimum m/z that we bin from, all data less than this is 'chopped off' and thus is no longer considered.
        </option>
		<option name="Bin Width">
			This refers to the bin width of all bins. If the bin is larger, we can expect more m/z to fit into it and thus it will get larger values.
