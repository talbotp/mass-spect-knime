<body>
	This package implements KNIME logic for limiting m/z and intensity values by a user specified m/z range as a KNIME node.
		
	<p>
		The <code>LimitMZModel</code> implements the logic associated for this, it checks if a certain value is in the range specified by the user, 
		and then proceeds to remove them if they are invalid, and kept otherwise.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <code>LimitMZDialog</code> is a simple GUI allowing the user to specify the minimum and maximum m/z values they wish the outgoing data to have.
