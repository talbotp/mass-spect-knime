<body>

	This package implements a KNIME node for combining m/z and intensity values into one table.
	N.B this means that the m/z must match eachother, ie the data must no longer be in a "processed" format.

	<p>
		The <code>ImzMLChunkReaderRowSpectrumNodeModel</code> stores KNIME logic for combining the tables.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The node takes no user input and thus has no dialog.
	</p>
