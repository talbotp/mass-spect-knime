        <intro>
        	Load a certain number of spectra from an imzML dataset into memory with the rows as spectrums.
        	This is suitable for large imzML datasets, and must be used with a Loop End or Loop End (2 ports) node as found in the Workflow Control category in the node repository.
       		Each spectrum is assigned a row in the outgoing DataTables.
        </intro>
        
        <option name="imzML file location">
        	Get the location of the imzML file to be loaded into KNIME. Please ensure the .imzML and .ibd files are in the same directory.
        </option>

    <ports>
      	<outPort index="0" name="m/z Data">
     		The outgoing data consists of k rows of spectra m/z values (k is specified by the user).
     	</outPort>
        <outPort index="1" name="Intensity Data">
        	The outgoing data consists of k rows of spectra Intensity values (k is specified by the user).

    <views>
        <view index="1" name="imzML Information" >
        	This displays a table of information about the loaded dataset.
        	The table consists of useful info, including minimum m/z, maximum m/z, whether the imzML is processed/continuous etc.
