KNIME NOTES:

How can I structure the Knime node so that it will work with a MVC style of GUI - and with the KNIME client.

	1) Perhaps a good idea to create a class containing the logic and algorithms required for the program.

	2) Next, it may be a good idea to Create The appropriate KNIME nodes and simply import the logic and call methods from the class with the logic.

Perhaps I should make the plugin a separate category on its own.


REQUIRED:

	PROVIDED BY THE EXTENSION WIZARD:
	- plugin.xml
	- build.properties

	FOR EACH NODE:
	- NodeFactory, NodeModel
	- NodeFactory.xml
	- NodeDialogPane, NodeView (optional)

NOTES:
NodeFactory bundles the NodeModel, NodeDialog, NodeView, and description XML.

NodeDialog is for a node that requires special user settings as input. Use DefaultComponent to create simple, quick user input.

Should I make a node for each possible method and package it into a category?
