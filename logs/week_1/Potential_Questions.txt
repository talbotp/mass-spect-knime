Potential questions: 

0) ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT PROJECT PROPOSAL, in particular timings of the project and what are the actual achievements to aim for each part of the project.

1) Lots of emphasis on talking about being able to handle large datasets. How do we handle this? As of yet no talk as to how they handle this. - just read that they use binning or cutting

- spectrum mode and imaging mode, store both in a seperate file so they can be used simultaneously.
- openMSI uses chunking of data to accelerate the access of selective data, ie it processes specific parts at a time, the other parts are then stored, and processed later/before.
- data reduced and then stored so that it can be accessed quickly.
- look at one spectrum at a time (this requires around 1-2 MB of memory as opposed to the 10s of GB for the whole dataset
)

2) Use of scala? Is it possible?

3) Data formats? 

- imzML data?
- i basically want to make msiQuant which allows the user to choose their workflow or follow a more traditional GUI based approach as it allready does.

4) SOLID Principles should be followed for Extensible software development.

5) The widely accepted order for preprocessing time-of-flight (TOF) data is smoothing or denoising followed by baseline correction prior to peak detection. WHY? (specifically why is this the accepted ordering.)

6) Next week after the meeting I must set a list of goals and Achieved Tasks.
