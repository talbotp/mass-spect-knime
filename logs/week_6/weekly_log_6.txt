Weekly Log 6 : Week commencing 23 July 2018

	This was a challenging week: 
	
	I managed to get the M/Z viewer working well, and is stable now.

	I implemented Self Organising Maps into KNIME.

	I tried to implement Normalised Cuts algorithm into KNIME. However, I had some trouble here as the algorithm was confusing.

	Same here with the ToMaTo implementation, I struggled here due to the code being in C++, and my unfamiliarity with this language.


	Next week : I must implement these two clustering algorithms and then move onto some experimental work.

Next Meeting : Monday 30th July 2018: 9:30
