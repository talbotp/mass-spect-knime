Weekly Log 3: Week commencing Monday 2nd July 2018

This Week:

	As was suggested in the last meeting, I have been designing these nodes with a smaller use, i.e. each node does ONE thing, then it can link with other nodes in order to add more features. This is making the node design SIGNIFICANTLY easier.

	The first attempt that I showed in the first meeting, I am now considering this to be a throwaway prototype. But I am utilising a similar package structure. Just implementing some of the methods in a more logical way.

	Goals:
	- fully implement all reader nodes.
	- fully implement limit m/z and roi nodes.
	- catalogue and document the following methods for the next Tuesday meeting:
		+ rebinning of spectra
		+ savitzky-golay smoothing
		+ some form of normalization? How will i interface this with the other nodes
	
	Done: 
    - all reader nodes implemented, and partially documented.
    - ROI node is completed
    - have been cataloguing and documenting methods for rebinning, smoothing, still need to figure out normalisation.

	Challenges:
	- how can i interface the normalisation method? I am finding that very confusing.

	Next Week goals:
    - Will see most at new meeting on tuesday.
    - finish all work with knime will be the plan if i can get loads done next week.
