Weekly Log 7 : Week commencing 30th July 2018

	- Have spent some time working on the implementation of N Cuts algorithm, and dedicated some time to Java Native Interface trying to get ToMaTo to work, have had trouble with both of these.

	- Worked on some Unit tests for the logic in the Nodes.

	
Meetings are now less scheduled and are more random in their timeframes, so i will no longer add a next meeting line in the weekly logs.
