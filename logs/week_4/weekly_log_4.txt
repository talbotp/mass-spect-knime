Weekly Log 4 : Week commencing 9 July 2018

This Week:

	Goals:
	- Fully implement all preprocessing nodes.

	Done: 
	- Baseline and normalisation nodes.
	- Had some trouble with peak detection etc nodes.

	- Found a lot of good papers on signal / spectra preprocessing.

	Challenges:
	- Peak detection nodes and generally finding actual algorithms can be quite challenging.

	Next Week goals:
	- Finish off all documentation and visualisation of the data within KNIME.

	- Then we can move onto the other part of the project. :)
